# MyRPG / Heimdall
A fantasy RPG made in group of 4 with the __CSFML Lib__ .<br />

## Introduction

  * The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.<br />
  * There must be NPC in your game.<br />
  * You need to implement at least one quest.<br />
  * The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.<br />
  * The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.<br />
  * With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.<br />
