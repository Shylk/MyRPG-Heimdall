## Introduction
### Organisation
 * Use of a "Trello" to list all features to do, what is done and who is working on what features.
 * Project made while we were quarantined so we had to discuss a lot everyday about everything in the project.
 * Brainstorming, and talking a lot for the conception of the project for a few days.
 * Each features coded has to be approved by the group or is reworked until we are all satisfied if we do have enough time.
 * We share our problems and code parts done through all the day.
 
### Project length
